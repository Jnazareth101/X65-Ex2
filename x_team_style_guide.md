# X-Team 65 Style Guide

We are all using similar style guides to prevent spaces vs tabs, using tabs primarily. 

## Naming conventions

We will name variables and methods based on what they do/ what they are, using comments if necessary. Keeping local variables and instantiated variables the same name, using this. to keep track of the variables.

### Examples
* interfaces
* classes
* exception types
* fields
* methods
* parameters
* local variables
* instance constants
* class constants

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:

Primarily use // for commenting inside methods. We won't use a new line to begin the opening brace for a method. We will tab in spacing for methods/statements within classes. We won't be using terniary statements as much in our coding.

### Examples

* classes
* fields
* constructors
* methods
* coding style (brackets, horizontal, and vertical spacing) for:
  * if statements
  * switch statement
  * while loops
  * for loops
  * enhanced for loops
  
```
/**
 * Method Header
 */
 public method() {
// in line comments
}
```
