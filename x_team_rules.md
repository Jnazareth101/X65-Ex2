# X-Team 65 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will order ourselves and assign methods/ tasks to each of us based on volunteering. If more than one person volunteers for the same task, we will have our leader assign tasks to us.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will use To-Do using Eclipse and To-Do list on Github and verify with others.
#### Example Todo list:
- [X] Finished Task
- [ ] Task still not completed

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Ask for help using our snapchat group and use pictures if necessary to help each other get a proper solution.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Make sure to tell the others in our group when we can do the work assigned and verify work is done with others. We will also check each others work a few days prior to debug and make sure our work parts are functional.
